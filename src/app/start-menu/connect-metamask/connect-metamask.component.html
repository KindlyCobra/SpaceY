        You are not yet connected to MetaMask.<br>
        In order to play this game you have to install the BrowserPlugin MetaMask.<br>
        Download it and create an account. You don't have to save any passphrase as long as you only use the account on
        the testnet.<br>
        So NEVER send real Mainnet Ethereum to your account unless you saved the passphrase!<br>
        <br>
        Currently the game is only running the GÃ¶rli Testnet, so make sure its selected at the top of MetaMask.<br>
        Afterwards you will have to get some test Ethers. Testnets have services called faucets where you can get some
        free test Ethers.<br>
        <a href="https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/">Click me to receive tests Ethers</a>
        <br><br>
        Now allow this website to access MetaMask, you might have to reload this site after installing MetaMask.
